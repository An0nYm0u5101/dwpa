Just some maintenance scripts/SQL

1. Revert bogus get_works after given date
SELECT *
FROM dicts, (SELECT d_id, COUNT(d_id) AS c
             FROM n2d
             WHERE ts >= '2014-09-14'
             GROUP BY d_id) AS d
WHERE dicts.d_id=d.d_id

UPDATE dicts, (SELECT d_id, COUNT(d_id) AS c
               FROM n2d
               WHERE ts >= '2014-09-14' GROUP BY d_id) AS d
SET hits=hits-c
WHERE dicts.d_id=d.d_id


SELECT nets.net_id
FROM nets, (SELECT net_id, COUNT(net_id)
            FROM n2d
            WHERE ts >= '2014-09-14'
            GROUP BY net_id) AS n
WHERE nets.net_id=n.net_id

UPDATE nets, (SELECT net_id,count(net_id) AS c
              FROM n2d
              WHERE ts >= '2014-09-14' GROUP BY net_id) AS n
SET hits=hits-c
WHERE nets.net_id=n.net_id

2. Get random cracked net
SELECT *
FROM nets
WHERE net_id >= (SELECT MAX(net_id)
                 FROM nets)*RAND()-1
      AND n_state=1
LIMIT 1

3. Fill bssid table
INSERT IGNORE INTO bssids(bssid, ts) SELECT bssid, MIN(ts) FROM nets GROUP BY bssid
